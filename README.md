# What-is-a-data-product?
I recently started a new role at TerminusDB and my first real content piece is focused around *what is a data product?*

As a fundamental part of data mesh, a relatively new paradigm on a decentralized data architecture, treating data as a product is a way of handing responsibility for data to those who generate it, namely the domain leaders. 

The term **data product** is quite ambiguous so I wanted to address it with an article focused around the key principles to help people interested in data mesh get their head around the concept of treating data as a product.

Anyway, here's the link to the article, I hope you enjoy. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
